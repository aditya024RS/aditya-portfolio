# Blog in Detail

GitHub is more than just a place to host code — it’s your **public portfolio**.  
Every commit, PR, and contribution reflects your growth as a developer.

## Why Open Source Matters

- **Proves Collaboration** → You learn to work with real teams, not just solo projects.  
- **Real-World Problems** → Open-source projects often mirror industry challenges.  
- **Credibility** → Recruiters love seeing public contributions over private projects.  

## How to Start

1. **Pick Small Issues**  
   - Look for `good first issue` or documentation fixes.  
   - Even improving README files counts.  

2. **Learn the Workflow**  
   - Fork → Clone → Branch → Commit → Pull Request.  

3. **Be Consistent**  
   - Don’t chase “stars,” chase **contributions that help people**.  

## My Journey

I began by building my own repositories like AdiBook and Movie Recommendation App.  
Next, I plan to contribute to Java + React projects in open source communities to sharpen collaborative coding skills.

## Takeaway

Open-source is about **giving back and growing together**.  
Even small contributions can make a big difference — for the project, and for your career.
