# Blog in Detail

This portfolio wasn’t just a weekend project — it was a **learning journey**.  
Here’s what went into it.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js + TypeScript** → For a modern, fast React framework.  
- **Tailwind CSS** → Clean styling, with custom accents.  
- **Framer Motion** → Smooth animations (hero, cursor, modals).  
- **NodeMailer** → For sending real emails from the contact form.  

## Design Decisions

- Chose a **Minimal with a Twist** vibe → clean layout, but with subtle interactivity (creative cursor, animated hero).  
- Added **dark mode toggle** → to balance professionalism with modern design.  
- Focused on **responsiveness** → recruiters might check this on phone.  

## Challenges

- Fixing Tailwind config errors (`accent-*` colors).  
- Debugging `Button` imports.  
- Handling broken nav links between `/` and `/blog`.  

Each bug taught me patience, debugging, and system thinking.  

## Lessons Learned

1. **Plan in phases** → Breaking into Phase 0–10 made everything manageable.  
2. **Accessibility matters** → Color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels.  
3. **Show, don’t tell** → Projects with screenshots and live demos are far stronger than descriptions.  

## Closing Note

This portfolio reflects who I am:  
**Minimal code, maximal impact.**
