# Blog in Detail

When applying for software engineering roles, your **portfolio is your proof of work**.  
It’s not just about listing skills on a CV — it’s about **showing them in action**.

## What Recruiters Look For

- **Clean Design** → A portfolio doesn’t have to be flashy, but it should feel professional.  
- **Real Projects** → Build things beyond tutorials. Recruiters want to see original, practical apps.  
- **Storytelling** → Each project should answer: _what problem did you solve, why does it matter, and how did you build it?_  

## What to Showcase

1. **Projects** → Highlight 3–4 of your strongest works.  
   - Example: Recyconnect (sustainability app), AdiBook (bookstore platform), Movie Recommendation App.  

2. **Skills in Action** → Use animations, interactive timelines, or even code snippets to show skills.  

3. **Contact Info** → Make it easy to reach you — email, GitHub, LinkedIn.  

## My Key Takeaway

A portfolio is not just decoration — it’s **your live résumé**.  
It should tell your story, back it up with real work, and make recruiters excited to call you.
